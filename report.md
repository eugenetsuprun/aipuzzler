# Crew Performance Report on AI-proof Puzzle

## Introduction
This report outlines the performance of the crew in developing the function `unique_palindromic_substrings` and discusses the problem iteration process. We also evaluate if an AI-proof puzzle was successfully created.

## Functionality Overview
The function `unique_palindromic_substrings(s: str) -> list[str]` is designed to find all unique palindromic substrings within a given string.

### Code Implementation
```python
def unique_palindromic_substrings(s: str) -> list[str]:
    n = len(s)
    unique_palindromes = set()

    def add_palindromes(left: int, right: int):
        while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:
            unique_palindromes.add(s[left:right + 1])
            left -= 1
            right += 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        add_palindromes(i, i)        # Odd length palindromes
        add_palindromes(i, i + 1)    # Even length palindromes

    return list(unique_palindromes)

def test_unique_palindromic_substrings():
    assert sorted(unique_palindromic_substrings("abba")) == sorted(["a", "b", "bb", "abba"])
    assert sorted(unique_palindromic_substrings("racecar")) == sorted(["r", "a", "c", "e", "racecar", "aceca", "cec"])
    assert sorted(unique_palindromic_substrings("")) == sorted([])
    assert sorted(unique_palindromic_substrings("a")) == sorted(["a"])
    assert sorted(unique_palindromic_substrings("ab")) == sorted(["a", "b"])
    assert sorted(unique_palindromic_substrings("aabb")) == sorted(["a", "b", "aa", "bb"])
    assert sorted(unique_palindromic_substrings("abcde")) == sorted(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"])

# Running the tests
test_unique_palindromic_substrings()
print("All tests passed.")
```

## Unit Test Results
- The execution of the unit tests confirmed that all assertions passed without errors.
- This confirms that the `unique_palindromic_substrings` function works as intended, handling various cases effectively. 

## Iteration on the Problem
During the development phase, initial concerns were raised regarding certain edge cases, such as empty strings and strings with no palindromic substrings. The function was iteratively refined to effectively handle these concerns.

## AI-proof Puzzle Evaluation
The crew aimed to design a puzzle that an AI would struggle to solve. The use of unique palindromic substring identification is inherently complex due to its combinatorial nature. However, the criteria for being "AI-proof" needs further exploration, as the function can still be approached algorithmically despite the complexity.

## Conclusion
**All tests passed successfully, confirming the correctness of the implementation of the `unique_palindromic_substrings` function.** The crew demonstrated effective problem-solving skills and successful iteration on the project, though the success of creating an AI-proof puzzle requires additional criteria for assessment.
