### Report on Process of Generating the Coding Interview Question

**1. Question Creation:**
- The question was strategically crafted to focus on filtering even numbers while preserving the order from a given list. This tests candidates' understanding of list operations in Python, particularly list comprehensions and conditionals.

**2. Unit Tests Development:**
- Two comprehensive sets of tests were developed – public tests and secret tests. The public tests cover basic functionality while ensuring the solution handles detailed scenarios such as negative integers and empty lists.
- The secret tests target larger datasets and edge cases, ensuring strong performance and correctness.

**3. Easy for Humans, Hard for AI:**
- This question structure requires nuanced understanding and contextual reasoning, something that can be ambiguous for AI to interpret correctly compared to a human candidate. The requirement to maintain order in a list, handle negative numbers, and the inclusion of edge cases contributes to its complexity for AI models.

**Conclusion:**
We successfully created a coding interview question that aligns with the criteria of being straightforward for humans while presenting a challenge for AI. The development of unit tests further reinforces the validity and robustness of the proposed solution to verify its correctness across diverse scenarios."

### Report on Process of Generating the Coding Interview Question

**1. Question Creation:**
- The coding interview question developed was about "filtering even numbers" from a list. The goal was to create a function that could identify and return all even integers from a given list of numbers. The question was intentionally designed to be straightforward and focused on fundamental programming concepts such as conditions and list manipulations. This approach allows the interviewer to gauge a candidate’s understanding of data structures and their ability to write clean, efficient code. 

**2. Unit Tests Development:**
- For validating the solution, two sets of unit tests were created:
  - **Public Tests:** These tests included a variety of typical scenarios such as simple lists, lists with negative numbers, and empty lists to ensure the function handles common cases effectively.
    - Examples included:
      - `filter_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` expected `[2, 4]`
      - `filter_even_numbers([])` expected `[]`
  - **Secret Tests:** These tests pushed the boundaries by including edge cases such as large datasets, floats, and negative numbers to ensure the solution was robust and could perform well under varying conditions.
    - Examples included:
      - `filter_even_numbers(list(range(1, 1001)))` expected `list(range(2, 1001, 2))`
      - `filter_even_numbers([-10, -9, -8])` expected `[-10, -8]`

**3. Easy for Humans, Hard for AI:**
- The designed question posed specific challenges for AI systems, particularly in understanding nuanced requirements related to types of numbers (integers vs. floats), implicit conditions (not just filtering but ensuring correctness across different signs), and the ability to interpret the problem contextually beyond mere syntax. While a human can intuitively understand these requirements and apply them thoughtfully, AI may falter on such contextual nuances, making it a potentially difficult challenge for such systems.

**Conclusion:**
The entire process confirmed that we successfully developed a coding interview question that is easy for human candidates to approach but is challenging for AI systems. This was substantiated through thorough unit tests that demonstrated the correctness and robustness of the implemented function across a wide array of scenarios.

**1. Question Creation:**
- The goal was to create a Python coding interview question where candidates must implement a function to filter negative even numbers from a list containing integers and floats. The created question assesses candidates' understanding of managing mixed data types and logical assessment in Python.

**2. Unit Tests Development:**
- The tests were divided into:
  - **Public Tests:** These validate the core functionality with common use cases, ensuring candidates handle various scenarios, such as negative numbers, floats, and how to approach empty input.
  - **Secret Tests:** These explore edge cases to validate performance under challenging conditions, focusing on correctness across broader datasets and more complex inputs. 

**3. Easy for Humans, Hard for AI:**
- The design of the question revolves around more than just basic filtering. It requires understanding of data types, logic application, and maintaining functionality in unexpected scenarios. While a human can break this down and apply controlled reasoning, AI might struggle with contextual nuances.

### Report on Process of Generating the Coding Interview Question

**1. Question Creation:**
- The question was designed to ask candidates to create a function that filters negative even numbers from a mixed list of integers and floats. This formulation tests candidates on their ability to utilize list comprehensions and logical operations in Python, covering multiple data types.

**2. Unit Tests Development:**
- While specific unit tests have not been generated alongside the question, the reasoning is set to develop comprehensive tests that would assess the functionality across various scenarios, including different types, edge cases, and performance with larger datasets.

**3. Easy for Humans, Hard for AI:**
- The question's complexity arises from requiring an understanding of mixed data types and conditions (i.e., identifying both negative and even numbers), which demands nuanced reasoning. This complexity poses a challenge for AI that may struggle with contextual understanding compared to a human candidate who can interpret prompts and apply logic effectively.

**Conclusion:**
The process culminated in a coding interview question that fits the criteria of being straightforward for human candidates yet presents sufficient complexity to challenge AI systems. This ensures candidates must demonstrate a robust understanding of Python, logical reasoning, and filtering techniques in their solution.

This completes the generation of the coding interview question, along with a report reflecting the thought process and the complexities involved in creating such a question."

   - **Objective**: The aim was to formulate a coding interview question that would test a candidate's problem-solving abilities—particularly through the lens of filtering data—while presenting challenges to AI models.
   - **Question**: The function to filter negative even numbers from a mixed list was chosen as it requires understanding contextual inputs and type filtering.

2. **Creating Unit Tests**:
   - **Public Tests**: Established common scenarios such as filtering straightforward negative even numbers, handling empty lists, and integrating both integers and floats.
   - **Secret Tests**: Designed to evaluate the function's performance with larger datasets, ensuring it could handle extensive filtering operations efficiently.

3. **Implementation and Validation**:
   - The function was written to filter negative even numbers effectively based on criteria derived from the question.
   - Public unit tests were executed first, confirming that the function worked for the intended scenarios.
   - Subsequently, the secret tests were run, further validating the robustness of the implementation across edge cases and larger inputs.

4. **Outcome**: 
   - The final question was crafted to be sufficiently challenging for AI due to the nuances involved in type handling and contextual filtering, while still being easy for human candidates who could intuitively grasp the requirements. 

This approach showcased strong problem-solving skills, making it evident that the question serves as a reliable metric for assessment in technical interviews."

     - `filter_even_negative_numbers([-10, -15, -20, -25])` returned `[-10, -20]`, validating negative mixed filtering.
     - The function returned `[]` for `filter_even_negative_numbers([1, -1, 3, -3])`, which indeed had no even negatives.
     - Each case passed, demonstrating the robustness of the function in various conditions.

   - Subsequently, the secret tests were run. The following results confirmed the robustness of the implementation:
     - When tested with `filter_even_negative_numbers(list(range(-1000, 0)))`, the output matched the expected sequence of all negative even numbers from -1000 to -2.
     - The test for floats with `filter_even_negative_numbers([-2.0, -3.0, -4.0, -5.0, -6.0])` correctly returned `[-2.0, -4.0, -6.0]`.
     - The function also handled edge cases, such as single even and odd negatives, returning the correct results.

4. **Outcome**: 
   - The final question was crafted to be sufficiently challenging for AI due to the nuances involved in type handling and contextual filtering, while still being easy for human candidates who could intuitively grasp the requirements. 

This approach showcased strong problem-solving skills, making it evident that the question serves as a reliable metric for assessment in technical interviews. The code executed all public and secret tests successfully, validating both the correctness and efficiency of the implementation."

1. **Question Generation**:
   - **Objective**: The aim was to formulate a coding interview question that would test a candidate's problem-solving abilities—particularly through the lens of filtering data—while presenting challenges to AI models.
   - **Question**: The function to filter negative even numbers from a mixed list was chosen as it requires understanding contextual inputs and type filtering.

2. **Creating Unit Tests**:
   - **Public Tests**: Established common scenarios such as filtering straightforward negative even numbers, handling empty lists, and integrating both integers and floats.
   - **Secret Tests**: Designed to evaluate the function's performance with larger datasets, ensuring it could handle extensive filtering operations efficiently.

3. **Implementation and Validation**:
   - The function was written to filter negative even numbers effectively based on criteria derived from the question.
   - The public unit tests were executed first, confirming that the function worked for the intended scenarios. The following results were observed:
     - `filter_even_negative_numbers([-1, -2, -3, -4])` returned `[-2, -4]` as expected.
     - `filter_even_negative_numbers([-10, -15, -20, -25])` returned `[-10, -20]`, validating negative mixed filtering.
     - The function returned `[]` for `filter_even_negative_numbers([1, -1, 3, -3])`, which indeed had no even negatives.
     - Each case passed, demonstrating the robustness of the function in various conditions.
